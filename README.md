This Repository is corrosponding to the Connectome-based Predictive Modeling (CPM). 
The main goal of this algorithm is based around finding the most correlated edges in brain connectome with human behavior measures. 
Based on this, there is a a set of edges positively correlating with measures and a set negatively correlating. 
CPM aims to fit a model which is able to predict human behaviors (e.g., fluid intelligence) for testing subjects.
